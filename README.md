# Disclaimer

Although I do know few things about math, please be aware that I am not nearly an expert in it. It means that it may 
happen that I use a wrong terminology here and there, but even if this happens everything implemented is explained in 
examples, so you'll be able to understand the purpose anyway.

It's also important to mention that it isn't my intention to create a comprehensive and full-featured tensor library. 
Instead, I will create only few things that I've needed for my projects.
