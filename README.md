# Disclaimer

It's important to mention that it isn't my intention to create a comprehensive and full-featured tensor library. 
Instead, I will create only few things that I've needed for my projects.

# Motivation / The Problem

During my work on numerical solutions for different problems, I was often encountering situation in which I need to 
calculate some tensor based on input values from several vectors/matrices/tensors. Here are few examples of such 
encounters:

![\Large T_{[m*n*p]} \to t_{i,j,k}=a_i*b_j*c_k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large%20T_{[m*n*p]}%20\to%20t_{i,j,k}=a_i*b_j*c_k)
